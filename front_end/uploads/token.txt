As you are using messaging mode, the chat_ends webhook will not be triggered, in case that the customer starts a conversation while the license is 
offline, and then closes it/leaves the website. This is because the actual conversation has not started yet, so when the customer leaves it is not 
actually finished - we are working on adjusting Zapier integrations for messaging mode, but at the moment the only solution I can suggest is to set
up additional webhook in Zapier, for "customer queued" event - this one will be triggered in such situations, and it’ll provide you with the 
following payload:
{
"event_type": "visitor_queued",
"event_unique_id": "xxxxxxxxx",
"token": "xxxxxxxx",
"license_id": "xxxxxxx",
"lc_version": "3",
"visitor": {
"id": "xxxxxxxx",
"name": "Krzysztof",
"email": "test@test.com",
"country": "Poland",
"city": "Wroclaw",
"language": "en",
"page_current": "https://website.address.com",
"timezone": "Europe/Warsaw"
}
}


Unfortunately, these chats (when agents are not available) trigger the New visitor 
in the queue. And the survey data is not available for that trigger.

Our team is working on a new version of the integration, that will allow 
to pass that data. However, we don't have ETA on when it will be added.

At the moment, you will need to export your chats using our API and check
 all chats that were started when agents weren't available and pass that 
data to HubSpot (surveys will be included in the exported chats' data).

I will paste the links you will need again.

Here is a link to the documentation and the method you will need:
https://developers.livechat.com/docs/messaging/agent-chat-api/v3.1/#get-archives

To authorize you will need to create a personal access token following this guide:
